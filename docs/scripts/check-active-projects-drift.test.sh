# Self-test for check-active-projects-drift.sh — proves the drift guard PASSES a
# fully-consistent fixture and FAILS each individual drift scenario, asserting on
# the guard's actual error so every case pins its OWN branch (a refactor that
# made one check's failure get mis-attributed to another's message would be
# caught here). Covered failure branches: a missing marker for each of the three
# markers that have one (actions-dirs, reusable-workflows-count,
# reusable-workflows-names, projects-submodules), the count tripwire for Actions
# and Reusable Workflows, the set-equality mismatch for all four checks (Actions,
# Reusable Workflows, Submodules, Templates page — both directions for Templates),
# and the hard die_missing guard fired when a required submodule/file is absent
# (distinct from drift: it exits with a "is the submodule checked out?" error
# rather than a drift message). Run in CI so the guard's correctness is
# continuously verified — a refactor that silently weakens any check is caught
# here, not in production drift.
#
# The guard reads its repo root from $GITHUB_WORKSPACE (falling back to the
# checkout when unset), so every case points it at a self-contained fixture tree
# under a tempdir — the test needs no submodule checkout and never touches the
# real repo.
