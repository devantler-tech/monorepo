#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# npm-toolchain.test.sh — every workflow job that installs, audits or builds the site uses
# the npm major that writes docs/package-lock.json (monorepo#3749).
#
# WHY: Dependabot writes the lockfile with npm 11, its default for a version-3 lockfile.
# npm 10 and npm 11 disagree about which optional peer entries a lockfile must hold, so a
# lockfile one major writes fails the other major's `npm ci` sync check, and every
# dependency update of the site went red. docs/package.json declares the npm major in
# devEngines.packageManager, and npm refuses to install, audit or run with another major.
# This test keeps the workflows on a Node line that bundles that major, so no workflow can
# drift back unnoticed — including the publish workflow, which runs only on main.
#
# CHECKS
#   1. docs/package.json declares devEngines.packageManager as npm "^<major>.0.0" with
#      onFail "error".
#   2. Every job in .github/workflows that works in docs/ (see jobs_query) has exactly one
#      actions/setup-node step, placed before its first step in docs/, with an explicit
#      node-version on a Node line whose bundled npm is that major. The known jobs must all be
#      found, so an empty discovery cannot pass.
#   3. CI runs this test from a job that its own inputs gate, and that gate covers every
#      workflow, so a new workflow that works in docs/ reruns it.
#
# Fixture cases first prove each check rejects the drift it exists for.

# One row per job that works in docs/: job id, setup-node step count, node-version and

# job's first step in docs/. "-" stands for an absent value, because `read` collapses empty
# tab-separated fields. It is a jq program over yq's JSON rendering of the workflow: the
# runner's yq is older than this host's and rejects parts of the same program in yq syntax.
# A job works in docs/ when its own or the workflow's default working directory is docs/, a
# step's working directory is, or a step enters it with cd, pushd or npm --prefix. Any path
# with a docs component counts (./docs, ${{ github.workspace }}/docs), quoted or not. A step
# that runs npm or npx anywhere counts too: npm is the tool whose major matters, so naming it
# does not depend on spotting how a step reaches docs/. A false positive fails loudly here,
# never silently.
