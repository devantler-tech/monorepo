title: 🐹 Go Template
description: A minimal Go template with CI/CD, test coverage via GitHub Code Quality, Go Report Card, and Dependabot.
---

A minimal, batteries-included template for new Go projects. Skip the boilerplate — start shipping.

**Repository**: [devantler-tech/go-template](https://github.com/devantler-tech/go-template)

## What's Inside

- **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions workflows for build, test, lint, and release
- **Testing** — `go test` with coverage reporting via [GitHub Code Quality](https://docs.github.com/code-security/code-quality)
- **Quality** — [Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/) integration for continuous code-quality feedback
- **Dependency management** — [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot) keeps Go modules and Actions up to date
- **Release automation** — Semantic versioning and automated GitHub Releases

## Getting Started

```bash
# Create a new repo from the template
gh repo create my-project --template devantler-tech/go-template --public --clone
cd my-project

# Repoint the module path (go.mod, imports, README badges) in one shot — run this
# first. With no argument it derives the path from your origin GitHub remote.
# The script also runs `go mod tidy`; review the result with `git diff`.
scripts/rename-placeholders.sh github.com/<you>/my-project

# Run tests
go test ./...
```
